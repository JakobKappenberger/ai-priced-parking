# WHAT IS IT?

This is a model of traffic moving in a city grid. A portion of the agents tries to park on the curbside or the parking garages. The model is based on the traffic grid model by (Wilensky, 2003) and the seminar paper by (Aziz et al., 2020).



# Environment

The model’s environment is defined by a grid layout of roads and blocks. Located at the curbside, the yellow, green, teal, and blue patches designate parking spaces that are randomly scattered across the grid. Stripes of parking places situated opposite to one another are grouped. The coloring, indicating the different CPZs (Controlled Parking Zones) in the model, is then assigned depending on the distance of the groups to the center of the map, with the brightness of the colors decreasing the larger this distance grows. Due to their centrality, the green and, mainly, the yellow CPZ can be interpreted as most closely resembling the Central Business District (CBD) of the simulated city center. Beyond that, this model also introduces parking garages to account for off-street parking represented by the large blocks of black patches scattered across the map.

# Agents and Attributes

The central agents of our model are cars moving across the grid. In particular, 90% of all vehicles look for parking, and the remainder traverses the grid. For each car cruising for parking, a random parking duration is drawn from a gamma distribution, which was adopted from (Jakob & Menendez, 2021).

### Income

For every car, an income is randomly drawn from a log-normal distribution. Related work shows that the income of up to 99% of the population can be approximated with a two-parameter log-normal distribution (Clementi & Gallegati, 2005).


We calibrated the two parameters (the population mean and the population median) following the income distribution of the country our model city is located in. Based on the standard deviation, cars are divided into three income classes: Incomes within one standard deviation of the mean (68.2% of the population) are assigned the “middle-income” class. Deviations above or below this mark are called “high-” or “low-income”, (both 15.8% of the population) respectively.

### Willingness to Pay (WTP)

This variable captures the amount of money a driver is willing to pay for parking per
hour. Although income is a significant determinant of WTP, studies stress the importance of behavioral factors such as perceived comfort and security. To account for this individual variance, we randomly draw the WTP for each driver from a gamma distribution dependent on their income class.

Due to a lack of empirical evidence, the parameters of the distribution were manually calibrated to preserve the correlation between income and WTP and to ensure the functioning of the underlying parking routines in the model, i.e. to avoid excluding low-income drivers completely from parking: While for low-income drivers a mean of 2.5€ per hour was selected, the means for middle- and high-income cars amount to 4.5€ and 8€ per hour, respectively. Concerning the variance, for every income level, it was calibrated to correspond to the respective variance of the class-specific income distribution relative to its mean, mimicking the shapes of the individual intra-class income distributions. Specifying whether they are willing to park on a parking place without paying, the agents own the attribute parking-offender?.


# Behavioral Rules

### Navigation

All cars navigate the grid with previously assigned goals. For traversing cars, this goal is one of the exit points of the street network. For cars seeking to park, destinations are assigned with probabilities inversely proportional to their distance to the center of the grid, accounting for the higher popularity of the CBD. After target assignment, cars curate a list of the closest parking opportunities and elect the shortest route to the first one according to the NetLogo network extension.4 Upon arrival, cars attempt to park in the road of their assigned target. If no spot is available (or if spots are too expensive), cars move to the next list item. Similar to (Shoup, 2011), garages are only considered if there is no curbside parking at a cheaper cost since curbside parking is generally considered the more attractive option.

### Parking

Once a car has entered the street with its parking location of choice, it requests the fee of the closest available CPZ. If the fee is within the WTP, the car parks and the fee is added to the municipality revenues; if the fee exceeds the WTP, the driver will resume searching. We assume that WTP increases proportionally to the time spent cruising for parking. If a car belongs to the parking offenders, it will calculate the probability of getting caught. For this calculation, we assume rational actors with complete knowledge of the environment (i.e., the number of controls per hour and the fine as a multiple of the parking price are known a priori to offenders). Upon completion of their parking time, cars leave the CPZ and navigate towards the edge of the grid, where they are replaced with newly set up cars. In contrast, cars unable to find parking are not replaced once they leave the map. This preserves the change to the social distribution in the model that this behavior introduces.
